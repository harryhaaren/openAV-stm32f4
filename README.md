Intro
-----
This is a repository containing code examples that are introduced by the article
at the link above. Please read it, and you'll be able to get started with the
code quickly and understand the tools used in this repository.

These tutorials assume the device in use is a STM32 F4 Discovery (also referred
to as the STM32F407). This device is particularly useful for audio fanatics, as
it has an onboard audio-capable DAC, and a class D speaker driver.

DSP and FPUs
------------
Inside the CPU there is a hardware Floating-Point-Unit(FPU), which allows us to 
do calculations with float variables pretty fast. Since almost all Digital 
Signal Processing(DSP) is done using floating point, its very useful to have a
hardware FPU.
